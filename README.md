# DFS

a C++ program that asks the user for the name of a file that contains a digraph’s vertices and edges. 
The program reads a digraph’s vertices and the edges from the given text file,
Then, it creates an adjacency matrix and print the adjacency matrix.  
Then, it creates an adjacency list and print the adjacency list.  
Then, it prints out the order the vertices are traversed using the depth-first search (DFS) algorithm.
